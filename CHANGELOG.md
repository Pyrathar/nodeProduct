## Changelog for ASD KYC
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Guideline
 
Group changes by date and the respective application with sub-headlines for _Added_, _Changed_, _Removed_ or _Fixed_.

Each change must then be preceded with its issue key (CLA-XXX).

Use triple backticks to highlight code examples:
```
 MyCode.run()
```

This changelog is also for non-developers, so reduce technical explanations to a minimum.
